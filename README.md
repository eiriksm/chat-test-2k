# Chat test 2000

---

This is just a test to get socket.io, rethinkdb, passport and bcrypt on an express app.

If you are wondering why the client js is simple, it is just because I wanted to write the client with no libraries needed.

TODOS are too many to be counted, but I'd rather go on to a new project

## Install:
- npm install
- start rethinkdb
- node app
- go to localhost:8000
- profit

#### Update Aug 7th 2015
This project is now almost 3 years old, and should be treated as such. The dependencies have been updated to still work, but quite a few things have changed in these years. For example if you plan to combine real-time and RethinkDB - you probably want to look at [changefeeds](http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/#changes)
